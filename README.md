## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to make a responsive nav bar with a toggle button. I also learnt to use classes for styling. I further gained more knowledge on the various CSS Units e.g rem, em, and their use cases. I learnt to use "Data Attribute". I learnt to use the CSS Transform Property.

### Continued development

I will continue to learn about the CSS Transform property and how to write concise and less code.

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive navbar tutorial using HTML CSS & JS](https://youtu.be/HbBMp6yUXO0) - This helped me to make the toggle button responsive using Data Attribute, I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [How to detect on click outside div with javascript](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/javascript/on+click+outside+div+javascript) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to detect a click outside an element. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
